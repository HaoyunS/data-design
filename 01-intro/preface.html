<h1>Preface</h1>
<h1>前言</h1>

<p>I hadn&rsquo;t written a book before, let alone an international, open-source book with more than 50 contributors from 14 different countries.</p>
<p>我在此之前从未写过书，更不用说来自14个不同国家的50多个捐助者的国际化，开放源码的书。</p>

<p>It started with a message on Kickstarter:</p>
<p>它的开始来自于Kickstarter的留言：</p>

<blockquote>Hi Trina! Stats dork from Chicago here&hellip;.Do you have any plans to include tutorials for basic data cleaning and data selection techniques for users who may not have any statistics background?</blockquote>
<blockquote>你好，特瑞娜！统计白痴芝加哥这里...。你有计划来介绍教程、基础数据清理和数据选择技术指导没有任何统计数字背景的用户？</blockquote>

<p>At the time, I didn&rsquo;t know that this one message would turn into a book, a community, and a global endeavor to make information design more accessible.</p>
<p>当时，我并不知道这个消息将会变成一本书，一个社区和一个全球性的努力，使信息的设计更容易。</p>

<p>The message author, Dyanna Gregory, was a statistical programmer who knew the challenges of teaching university-level stats to those who don&rsquo;t identify as math nerds. I was an entrepreneur building Infoactive, a web application to help people create interactive infographics and data visualizations. I was also a Reynolds Fellow at the Donald W. Reynolds Journalism Institute where my goal was to find ways to simplify the process of making data visualizations in newsrooms. I had launched a Kickstarter campaign to support Infoactive, and we had nearly 1,500 backers who were excited about breaking down barriers in data visualization.</p>
<p>该消息的作者，迪亚娜·格雷戈里，是教大学统计学中为数学书呆子而设计挑战的统计编程。我是一个企业家建立Infoactive，一个Web应用程序，以帮助人们创建交互式的信息图表和数据可视化。我当时也是跟随唐纳德·王·雷诺兹在新闻学院找到方法来简化数据可视化的新闻编辑。我已经发动了Kickstarter的运动，以支持Infoactive，我们有近1500名支持者兴奋打破壁垒，支持数据可视化。</p>

<p>We all believed in the vision of making data simple.</p>
<p>我们都相信可视化会让数据更简单。</p>

<p>But working with data can be far from simple. Data come in all different shapes, sizes, and flavors. There&rsquo;s no one-size-fits-all solution to collecting, understanding, and visualizing information. Some people spend years studying the topic through statistics, mathematics, design, and computer science. And many people want a bit of extra help getting started.</p>
<p>但随着数据而来的工作并非如此简单。数据可以是各种不同的形状，大小，和品味。有没有一个通用的解决办法，以收集，了解和可视化信息。有些人花几年通过统计学，数学，设计和计算机科学的研究课题。许多人想要一些额外的帮助下开始。</p>

<p>Dyanna and I began talking about what a plain-language data resource would look like. Usability was a big priority for us. It&rsquo;s hard to write a technical book that&rsquo;s easy for less-technical readers to digest, but we believed that it was an important challenge to tackle. We wanted to create a free resource that was well-designed, joyful to read, and easy to understand.</p>
<p>迪亚娜里和我开始谈论一个纯语言的数据资源将是什么样子。易用性是我们的首要任务。这是很难写的一本技术书籍，很容易让初入门的读者消化，但我们认为这是应对的重要挑战。我们希望创造一个有精心设计，快乐阅读，易于理解的资源。</p>

<p>Of course, the information would need to be accurate and we wanted to cover a range of different data concepts. We needed technical writers with an in-depth understanding of data, math, and statistics. We also needed editors who could comb over the content to make adjustments for simplicity and understandability and ensure that the chapters had a friendly, conversational tone. Our mission was to translate geek into non-geek &mdash; to make technical concepts more accessible to less-technical people.</p>
<p>当然，这些信息需要准确，我们想覆盖各种不同的数据概念。我们需要的技术作家要深入了解数据，数学和统计。我们还需要重新梳理内容，以使让内容简单易懂，并确保各章进行了能够衔接顺利。我们的任务是翻译成技术性强但易懂的书籍 - 以技术概念让大家更容易理解。</p>

<p>Dyanna and I made a call for contributors. Neither of us expected to see such a strong, positive response. Frankly, it blew our minds. Messages began pouring in from people from all over the globe who told us about their experiences working with data and design, or their lack thereof. What struck me the most was the number of self-identified &ldquo;non-math people&rdquo; who were hungry for a resource that could introduce them to data concepts in a manner that was simple, approachable, and even fun. They were motivated to pitch in and volunteer their time to make it happen.</p>
<p>迪亚娜和我就找出了贡献者。我们都不希望看到如此的一个强大的，积极的回应。坦率地说，它回响在我们的脑海中。消息开始从涌入来自于全国各地并向我们介绍了他们数据和设计的经验，或缺少其工作的热情。给我印象最深的是自我认定“非数学的人”，他们可以把数据概念介绍的很简单、平易近人，更有趣。</p>

<p>Dyanna and I kicked off the project in February with a Write-A-Thon in Chicago. We invited writers, data analysts, programmers, designers, and others to come together in person and talk about the project as a whole. We thought through the process, talked about data, opened up our laptops, and started writing.</p>
<p>迪亚娜和我二月份在芝加哥拉开帷幕项目。我们邀请作家，数据分析师，程序员，设计师和其他人一起，以谈项目为目的。我们通过这个过程，讲到数据，打开了我们的笔记本电脑，并开始写作。</p>

<p>After that, we contacted everyone who applied to contribute, and began figuring out who was going to do what. For an all-volunteer project with more than 50 contributors spread across many time zones, it was important to stay organized. We found project managers for different sections of the book, chose writers and editors for each chapter, and put together research and distribution teams. Chapter by chapter, the vision began to turn into a reality.</p>
<p>之后，我们联系了大家谁曾作出贡献，并开始找出谁是打算做什么。对于所有志愿者项目超过50贡献者分散在多个时区，重要的是要保持组织。我们发现，项目经理为本书的不同部分，选择了作家和编辑的每一个章节，并放在一起研究和销售团队。逐章，逐篇也开始变为现实。</p>

<p>For me, the best part of this project was having the honor of working with some of the smartest, funniest, most creative people I&rsquo;ve ever met. Again and again, I&rsquo;ve been blown away by their creativity, passion, and support. I&rsquo;m beyond grateful that I had the experience of creating this book with such an incredible group of people. <em>Data + Design</em> is truly a community effort.</p>
<p>对我来说，这个项目的最好的部分是与一些最聪明的，最有趣，最有创意的人工作。一次又一次，我被风吹走了创造力，热情和支持。我很感激，有怀这样一群神奇的人创造这本书的经历。<em>数据 + 设计</em>才是真正的努力。</p>

<p>This book isn&rsquo;t a final product. It&rsquo;s the beginning of a community process to improve our collective understanding of data and design. We&rsquo;re releasing the first edition now, but we&rsquo;re already working on more chapters for future releases and thinking about ways that we can improve. Together we can build upon it, translate it, transform it, and make it better with every iteration.</p>
<p>这本书是不是最终本。这是一个社会过程的开始到改进数据设计的最初设想。我们发布第一版本，但我们已开始着手为将来的版本中更多的章节和思考方式，我们可以改善。我们可以一起建立在它，翻译它，改造它，并使它与每一代更好。</p>
