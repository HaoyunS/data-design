<h1>调查问卷设计简洁</h1>

<p data-type="author">原作者：Ginette Law</p>
</header>

<section data-type="sect1">
<p>大多数人认为进行问卷调查就像搞一堆问题让人们来回答那么简单。简单吧？在某种程度上来说的确是的，但如果你想得到最好的数据，就要更复杂一点了。不过不需要担心，我们将在这里讲一些设计调查问卷的关键要素，从调查问卷的目的开始讲起。</p>

<h2>调查问卷的目的</h2>

<p>设计一个好的问卷调查的第一步是在你创建它<em>之前</em>就确认它的目的是什么。好的问卷调查搜集的是准确并且可被验证的数据，它们能让你做出具体的声明。如果你在决定从调查对象中搜集什么样的信息时就已经有了一个清晰的目的，那么这个就更容易做到了。</p>

<p>调查问卷通常帮助你做以下的事情中的一个或多个：</p>

<ul>
	<li>描述某事；</li>
	<li>描述事物间的联系；</li>
	<li>解释一个关系；或</li>
	<li>影响某事</li>
</ul>

<p>那么到底该如何给你的调查问卷想出一个不错的，定义明确的目的呢？你可以试着问自己如下的问题：</p>

<ul>
	<li>你通过这个调查问卷想得到什么？</li>
	<li>更确切地说，你到底想知道些什么？</li>
	<li>为什么知道它是很重要的事？</li>
	<li>有没有什么其它信息也可能有用？为什么？</li>
	<li>针对你想要搜集的数据而言，做一个调查问卷是正确的获得方式么？</li>
</ul>

<p>为了看这个过程是如何操作的，假设你是个正想要增加电视订阅收益的媒体大亨。你对扩展到互联网市场的潜在收益感兴趣。你确立了你的调查问卷的主要问题和目的是：</p>

<table class="custom question-and-answer">
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<th>调研问题</th>
			<th>目的</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><em>在网上看自己最喜欢的电视剧的人的比例是多少？</em></td>
			<td><strong>描述一个变量</strong>
			<p>在网上看电视节目的人的比例。</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<p>思考了一会儿之后，你意识到如果能得到更多细节将会更有帮助，所以你问了自己刚刚我们建议你问自己的问题：</p>

<table class="custom question-and-answer">
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<th>问题</th>
			<th>答案</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><em>你通过这个调查问卷想得到什么？</em></td>
			<td>来估算互联网市场的潜在收益。</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><em>更确切地说，你到底想知道些什么？ </em></td>
			<td>目前或者将来有多少人会想要在网上看电视。</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><em>为什么知道它是很重要的事？/em></td>
			<td>它可以帮助我们判定我们需要在网上服务的哪些方面进行改进以及这个投资是否值得。</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><em>有没有什么其它信息也可能有用？为什么？</em></td>
			<td>哪个年龄层更倾向于在网上看电视。</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><em>针对你想要搜集的数据而言，做一个调查问卷是正确的获得方式么？</em></td>
			<td>是的。</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<p>根据你对这些问题的回答，你把调查问卷的范围稍微扩大了一些：</p>

<table class="custom question-and-answer">
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<th>调研问题</th>
			<th>目的</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><em>我们如何从网上观众身上得到最大化的收益？</em></td>
			<td><strong>影响某事：</strong>
			<p>找出要想改进我们的网上服务我们需要做些什么。</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><em>是否年轻的观众比年长的观众更倾向于更多地在网上看电视剧？</em></td>
			<td><strong>描述事物间的联系；</strong>
			<p>描述观众的年龄到底和他（她）在网上看多少电视有什么关系。</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><em>如果其中一个年龄组在网上看更多的电视的话，是为什么呢？ </em></td>
			<td><strong>解释一个关系：</strong>
			<p>解释为何一个年龄组比另一个年龄组更喜欢在网上看电视。</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<p>现在你的调查问卷有了一组很好的，定义明确的问题。下一步就是选择哪种调查问卷对你的生意最有帮助了。</p>

<div data-type="warning">
<p>数据和数字都是很有力的，但有些时候人们做调查问卷的初衷就是错误的。如果你做调查问卷的目的是如下几种，那么你就错失了获得有意义的了解事实的机会：</p>

<ul>
	<li>你并不在乎结果，你只想告诉别人你有数据。</li>
	<li>你滥用得到的数据。</li>
	<li>相比得到可靠的结果来说，你更在乎别人对你的发现的看法。</li>
	<li>你在心中已经决定了结果应该是什么样子的。</li>
</ul>

<p>请记住，我们调查是为了获得进一步的了解，是为了测试猜测。这意味着尝试去搜集最准确和最有代表性的数据，而不仅仅是能支持你自己预想的看法和偏见，是件很重要的事情。</p>
</div>

<h2>Types of Surveys</h2>

<p>Now that you&rsquo;ve identified the purpose of your survey, you can use this to help you choose a type of survey. When it comes to choosing a survey type, the first big decision you&rsquo;ll have to make is <em>how</em> you want to distribute your survey to respondents. Surveys can be self-administered or administered.</p>

<h2>Self-Administered and Administered Surveys</h2>

<p>Self-administered simply means that respondents fill out a questionnaire by themselves, whereas administered means that an interviewer asks the questions. Each of these methods has advantages and disadvantages, summarized below.</p>

<p><b>Self-Administered Surveys</b></p>

<table class="custom good-and-bad">
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<th>Pros</th>
			<th>Cons</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<ul>
				<li>Good for limited budgets</li>
				<li>Large geographic reach</li>
				<li>Respondents can answer when convenient and at their own pace</li>
			</ul>
			</td>
			<td>
			<ul>
				<li>More difficult to distribute to populations with limited literacy</li>
				<li>Risk of respondents misinterpreting questions</li>
				<li>Risk of lower completion rate</li>
				<li>Requires extra effort to verify that the respondent was actually the person to whom the survey was addressed</li>
			</ul>
			</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<p><b>Administered Surveys</b></p>

<table class="custom good-and-bad">
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<th>Pros</th>
			<th>Cons</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<ul>
				<li>Tighter quality control</li>
				<li>Interviewers can clarify questions for respondents</li>
				<li>Can collect richer and more in-depth information</li>
				<li>Easier to reach specific or marginalized populations (e.g., the elderly or the homeless)</li>
			</ul>
			</td>
			<td>
			<ul>
				<li>Can be expensive</li>
				<li>Can be time consuming</li>
				<li>Risk of interviewer effect (e.g., an interviewer&rsquo;s interpretation of a question could bias some of the results)</li>
			</ul>
			</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<p>The table above mentions the interviewer effect. This is a phenomenon whereby the interviewers themselves influence the responses. This could happen because of the way they ask questions or phrase explanations, or because of another social factor altogether. For example, maybe the interviewer is incredibly good-looking and the respondent unintentionally gives answers that are biased towards impressing the interviewer!</p>

<p>Self-administered and administered surveys are each associated with certain types of surveys, as shown below:</p>

<h2>Types of Self-Administered Surveys</h2>

<h3>Web and Email Surveys</h3>

<p>One of the easiest and quickest ways you can conduct a survey is online. You can either have people fill out questionnaires directly on a website or send them a questionnaire via e-mail. There are even survey sites that let you design questionnaire forms, collect data, and analyze responses in real-time at an affordable rate. You&rsquo;ll find links to a few of these sites in the <a href="app01.html">resources section</a>.</p>

<div data-type="warning">
<p>Don&rsquo;t forget to read the Privacy Policies and Terms of Use before signing up though&mdash;especially if you&rsquo;re dealing with sensitive data&mdash;because these services are often subject to the laws of the countries in which they&rsquo;re based.</p>
</div>

<p>The downside to all of this convenience is that only regular internet or computer users are likely to fill out your survey.</p>

<h3>Web and email</h3>

<table class="custom good-and-bad">
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<th>Pros</th>
			<th>Cons</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<ul>
				<li>Fairly fast results</li>
				<li>Integrated support tools for images, sounds, video</li>
				<li>Relatively cheap</li>
			</ul>
			</td>
			<td>
			<ul>
				<li>Limited to people who have internet access</li>
				<li>Respondents can be a self-selected group of regular computer-users</li>
			</ul>
			</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<h3>Web</h3>

<table class="custom good-and-bad">
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<th>Pros</th>
			<th>Cons</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<ul>
				<li>Can invite participants through social media</li>
				<li>Can use survey sites</li>
			</ul>
			</td>
			<td>
			<ul>
				<li>Survey sites are subject to the laws of the countries in which they&rsquo;re based</li>
			</ul>
			</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<h3>Email</h3>

<table class="custom good-and-bad">
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<th>Pros</th>
			<th>Cons</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<ul>
				<li>Easier to survey a specific group</li>
			</ul>
			</td>
			<td>
			<ul>
				<li>Need email addresses in order to distribute survey</li>
			</ul>
			</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<h3>Mail Surveys</h3>

<p>Mail surveys are much like email surveys except that you&rsquo;re sending a paper version of the questionnaire by mail. They aren&rsquo;t limited to the population of internet users, but they can be more expensive because you have to pay for printing, paper, envelopes, and postage. You may also end up with a lower response rate because some people think it&rsquo;s a pain to mail anything, not just your survey. Including a pre-addressed, stamped envelope with the survey will often improve your overall response rate, but will, again, increase the overall cost to you.</p>

<h3>Mail</h3>

<table class="custom good-and-bad">
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<th>Pros</th>
			<th>Cons</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<ul>
				<li>Open to a wider population</li>
			</ul>
			</td>
			<td>
			<ul>
				<li>More expensive</li>
				<li>Lower response rate</li>
			</ul>
			</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<h2>Types of Administered Surveys</h2>

<h3>Phone Surveys</h3>

<p>Compared to online surveys, phone surveys may take less time for you to collect all the data you need because respondents answer questions immediately. However, if you need to complete a certain number of surveys and most people hang up on you, it might longer to collect data by phone!</p>

<p>It helps if questions are short and clear so that respondents can easily understand them over the phone. Try also to not take more than 15 to 20 minutes of your respondents&rsquo; time (both to be respectful of their time and to avoid losing their attention).</p>

<p>Another thing to keep in mind is that the interviewer and the respondent can&rsquo;t see each other. This can be both good and bad: good because it lessens the interviewer effect but bad because both parties may miss non-verbal cues.</p>

<table class="custom good-and-bad">
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<th>Pros</th>
			<th>Cons</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<ul>
				<li>Relatively fast results</li>
				<li>Higher quality control because trained interviewers administer the survey</li>
			</ul>
			</td>
			<td>
			<ul>
				<li>Can be more expensive</li>
				<li>Can&rsquo;t use images or video when asking questions</li>
				<li>Need a list of reliable phone numbers</li>
			</ul>
			</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<h3>Face-to-Face Surveys</h3>

<p>Unlike phone surveys, face-to-face surveys allow the interviewer and the respondent to see each other&rsquo;s facial expressions and body language. This can be helpful because the additional physical cues can help the interviewer and the respondent understand better understand each other; however, it can also lead to the respondent being further influenced by the interviewer&rsquo;s behavior and appearance.</p>

<p>Face-to-face surveys are limited geographically if interviewers and respondents have to meet in person. If they don&rsquo;t have to meet in person, the surveys can be conducted online using video conferencing software such as <a href="http://www.skype.com/">Skype</a> or <a href="https://www.google.com/hangouts/">Google Hangouts</a>.</p>

<table class="custom good-and-bad">
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<th>Pros</th>
			<th>Cons</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<ul>
				<li>Can collect more in-depth information</li>
				<li>Good for specific or hard-to-reach populations</li>
				<li>Better for long surveys</li>
			</ul>
			</td>
			<td>
			<ul>
				<li>Can be more expensive</li>
				<li>May have a stronger interviewer effect</li>
				<li>Can take longer to train interviewers and to complete enough surveys</li>
			</ul>
			</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>

<h2>Handouts</h2>

<p>So far, we&rsquo;ve talked about self-administered and administered surveys, but one of the most frequently-encountered type of survey is actually a combination of these. Say you want to hand out paper surveys and have people complete and return them immediately. The survey itself is self-administered, but since you have a trained person there who is available to answer questions, it also has features of an administered survey.</p>

<p>For this reason, handouts can be a good option if you have a limited budget but want to make sure you have someone available when the survey is completed to clarify any questions your respondents might have.</p>

<p>One of the disadvantages of handouts is that people may be rushed to complete the survey if you are catching them in passing, which can affect the quality of your data. You will also be limited to the population that is physically present in the location where you are giving the survey. This may not be an issue if you are targeting a specific group, such as college students, shoppers at a particular store, or residents of a certain region. If you&rsquo;re looking for a more general audience, however, you may consider handing the survey out in several different locations to reach a more diverse audience.</p>

<h2>Choosing a Survey Type</h2>

<p>Whew! That is a lot of information so far. As you can see, there are many types of surveys, each with its own pros and cons. With so many factors to consider, how do you decide which one to choose? Let&rsquo;s walk through a few scenarios of choosing a survey type. Remember, you&rsquo;re a media tycoon trying to expand your media empire.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s say you want to evaluate the potential of the internet market. If you&rsquo;re only interested in the online viewing habits of internet users, then a web or email survey cheaply and conveniently targets the group you&rsquo;re interested in. On the other hand, if you want to know how much of the general television viewing audience watches shows online, but you don&rsquo;t want to spend the time or the money to train interviewers, then a mail survey is a better option.</p>

<p>But wait a minute: you&rsquo;re a media tycoon! You have lots of money <em>and</em> you&rsquo;re a total data geek. You want to collect more in-depth information like:</p>

<ul>
	<li>How do families watch television programs in their homes?</li>
	<li>Which family members tend to watch TV online?</li>
	<li>What type of television program does each family member like to watch?</li>
	<li>Do they watch programs together?</li>
	<li>If so, what types of programs do they watch together? Do they ever fight about what to watch?</li>
</ul>

<p>In this case, a face-to-face survey is a great option because you can interview all the members of a household at the same time and collect higher quality data about the dynamics of television viewing in families.</p>

<p>Now let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;ve analyzed the data and the numbers look promising, so you decide to create a new online viewing experience for your users. You want to emphasize how great and cutting-edge your new service is by creating a catchy name and logo for it. If you want to see what people think about different logos, then phone surveys won&rsquo;t be helpful. On the other hand, if you want to see what people think about different names and slogans, then phone surveys are fine. If your new service is specifically targeting a younger audience of avid internet users, then you can avoid the extra cost of phone surveys and use an online survey instead.</p>

<p>If you have the time and resources to do so, you can also consider using more than one type of survey. For example, you may want to do an online and phone version of the same survey to increase response rates and improve your sample in both size and diversity. Or you may start by doing an online survey and then conduct a face-to-face survey afterwards to gain more insight from your initial results.</p>

<p>We hope these scenarios show you that choosing a survey type isn&rsquo;t a one-size-fits-all process. There isn&rsquo;t a nice and tidy formula that you can use to pick the perfect survey. Instead, it&rsquo;s up to your good judgment to balance the resources you have with the goals you&rsquo;re trying to achieve.</p>
