<p>When you cook, you go through certain steps in a consistent order. You figure out which ingredients you need, you gather them, you prep them, and finally you cook them and present your finished dish.</p>
<p>当你烹饪时，你需要按照一致的顺序来进行一些步骤。你找到你需要哪些材料，获取它们，准备它们，最后你烹饪</p>

<p>Creating a data visualization is a lot like cooking. You decide what data you need, you collect it, you prepare and clean it for use, and then you make the visualization and present your finished result.</p>

<p>When you’re cooking, it helps to understand what each ingredient does so you know what you can do with it. For example, salt and sugar look similar but achieve very different results!</p>
<p>In this section, we’ll talk about what the basic ingredient groups of data are and what can and can’t be done with them so you have a sense of how to properly work with them later on.</p>
